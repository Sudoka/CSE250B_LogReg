This is the code for the algorithm "t-logistic regression". 

[1] Nan Ding, S.V.N. Vishwanathan "t-logistic Regression", Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2010.  


m-file list for the algorithm: 

tlogistic_train.m  		% training t-logistic regression
tlogistic_test.m		% test t-logistic regression
exp_t.m				% compute exp_t
t_Loss_EM.m			% estimate z_n, used in \xi-step
t_Lossgrad_EM.m			% objective function and the gradient in the \theta-step

The L-BFGS algorithm in \theta-step is by applying the MinFunc Matlab package (Mark Schmidt, 2006). 


The experiments that we put in the paper can be found in ~/examples/. 

e.g.
test_[data_name].m     		% test error using 10-fold cross validation
test_[data_name]_xi.m		% plot the \xi plots
test_[data_name]_init.m		% test error with 50 different initialization of \theta
