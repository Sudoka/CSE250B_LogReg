## CSE 250B Project 1

### Goal
* understand: logistic regression, gradient-based optimization, practicialities of classifier learning
* implement code for training logistic regression models with L2 regularization
* implement stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
* use a standard library package for L-BFGS
* reproduce results for logistic regression in Figure 3 of the paper "t-Logistic Regression" by Nan Ding and S.V.N. Vishwanathan (NIPS, 2010)

### Report Outline 
1. Introduction
