\begin{document}

\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
The Abstract paragraph should be indented 1/2~inch (3~picas) on
both left and right-hand margins. Use 10~point type, with a
vertical spacing of 11~points. Two line spaces precede the Abstract.
The Abstract must be limited to one paragraph.
\end{abstract}


\section{HOW TO PREPARE CAMERA-READY COPY}
The collected papers of the 1993 NIPS conference will appear as
{\it Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 6}, edited
by Jack Cowan, Gerald Tesauro, and Joshua Alspector.  Papers
may be up to {\it eight} pages long.  Final camera-ready copy is
due at the publisher by January 7, 1994.  The book should be
published by April if everyone cooperates with these guidelines.

We are striving to produce a high-quality book with a uniform,
professional appearance, rather than just a random collection of
papers. Special \LaTeX{} macros have been prepared to allow
you to generate camera-ready copy in the same format as this
instruction sheet.  There are three ways you can obtain these
macros:

\section{SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR \LaTeX{} USERS}
The \verb+nips.sty+ file has been tested under \LaTeX{} version 2.09. 
Times Roman is the preferred typeface, so you will want to use the
version of \LaTeX{} with PostScript fonts pre-loaded.  On some systems
this is called ``pslatex''.

You may want to use this instruction file \verb+nips.tex+ as a
``shell'' for writing your paper.  All you have to do is replace
the author, title, etc., with your own information.  Please pay
attention to the instructions at the end of this sheet regarding
figures, tables, acknowledgements, and paper identification.

\section{GENERAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS}
\label{sec-format}

The line width is 5~inches (30~picas). The left margin is
1.75~inches (10.5~picas). Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing
of 11~points. Times Roman is the preferred typeface throughout.

Paper title is 17~point, caps/lc, bold, centered between
2~horizontal rules.  Top rule is 4~points thick and bottom rule is
1~point thick. Allow 1/4~inch space above and below title to rules.
The first rule is 2~inches (12~picas) from the top of the page.
Subsequent pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of
the page. 

Authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is centered above
the corresponding address.   The lead author's name
is to be listed first (left-most), and the Co-authors' names (if
different address) are set to follow.  If only one co-author,
center both the author and co-author, side-by-side.


One-half line space between paragraphs, with no indent.

\section{FIRST LEVEL HEADINGS}

First level headings are all caps, flush left, bold and in point
size 12. One line space before the first level heading and 1/2~line
space after the first level heading.

\subsection{SECOND LEVEL HEADING}

Second level headings must be flush left, all caps, bold and in
point size 10. One line space before the second level heading and
1/2~line space after the second level heading.

\subsubsection{Third Level Heading}

Third level headings must be flush left, initial caps, bold, and in
point size 10. One line space before the third level heading and
1/2~line space after the third level heading.

\vskip .5pc
Fourth Level Heading

Fourth level headings must be flush left, initial caps and Roman
type.  One line space before the fourth level heading and 1/2~line
space after the fourth level heading.

\subsection{CITATIONS, FIGURES, REFERENCES}
These instructions apply to everyone, whether they're using \LaTeX{},
TROFF, or some other formatter.

\subsubsection{Citations in Text}

Citations within the text should include the author's last name and
year, e.g., (Cheesman, 1985). Reference style should follow the
style that you are used to using, as long as the citation style is
consistent.

\subsubsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
footnote} in the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the
page on which they appear. Precede the footnote with a horizontal
rule of 2~inches (12~picas).\footnote{Sample of the second
footnote} 

\subsubsection{Figures} 

All artwork must be centered, neat, clean, and legible.  All lines
should be very dark for purposes of reproduction and art work
should not be hand-drawn.  Figure number and caption always appear
after the figure.  Place one line space before the figure caption,
and one line space after the figure. The figure caption is initial
caps and each figure numbered consecutively.

Make sure that the figure caption does not get separated from the
figure. Leave extra white space at the bottom of the page to avoid
splitting the figure and figure caption.
\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace{1in}
\caption{Sample Figure Caption}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible. Do not use
hand-drawn tables. Table number and title always appear before the
table.
See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

One line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title
must be initial caps and each table numbered consecutively.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Sample Table Title}
\label{sample-table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf PART}  &\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf DESCRIPTION}
\\ \hline \\
Dendrite         &Input terminal \\
Axon             &Output terminal \\
Soma             &Cell body (contains cell nucleus) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Identification} 

Make certain that your name is typed or written on the back of
every page of your masters, and number pages sequentially. This
information is for identification only. Final page numbers will be
assigned by the publisher. If you have preferred wording for a long
running head, please include this when you send your paper. 

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgements}

Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgements.  All
acknowledgements go at the end of the paper.


\subsubsection*{References}

References follow the acknowledgements.  Use unnumbered third level
heading for the references.  Any choice of citation style is
acceptable as long as you are consistent.
